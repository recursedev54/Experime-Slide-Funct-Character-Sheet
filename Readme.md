e.s.f. Album concept


Who are you?

I’m Experime-Slide-Funct. Bozo.

Bozo?

You callin’ me a clown, punk?

Experime-Slide-Funct, is that your real name?

Nah, its my stage name. You think anyone would be named Experime-Slide-Funct naturally?

I guess not... Stage name- what kind of performance do you do?

Well, that's a great question! I'm an experimental musician, and slide performer - with the slide guitar as my primary instrument.

You mean to tell me there is other performance venues outside The Expanse? Other dimensions have music venues too?

I'm afraid I have some bad news for you, my naive little friend. There are innumerable dimensions out there that make your little universe look like the kiddie table at a family reunion. And yes, each one has its own music venues, and they all make yours look laughable.

I already knew there were unnumerable dimesions, I just never seen any musicians outside The Expanse

Yeah, well the music scene outside of your little Expanse bubble makes it look like a third-rate kiddie talent show. Trust me, you ain't heard nothin' yet.

Which dimension do you live in? Nightworld? The Infernal Region? The Thread? The Ante-Rooms? Deep Space? The Cambrian Era? Or some dimension I've never heard of?

Ha! Those dimensions you mentioned are like the kindergarten of the universe. I live in a dimension called The Cosmic Symphony - a realm where music and the arts reign supreme.

Imagine a place where the concept of rhythm and harmony are not just musical concepts, but the very fabric of reality. Where sound and vibration create worlds, and every note is a star in the cosmic orchestra.

Yeah, you could say I'm living in a dimension you've never heard of.

Is that actually another dimension or just so far into Deep Space that you reach alternate universes?

Ohoho, little one, you think Deep Space is some sort of cosmic playground where dimensions come to play? That's cute.

But let me tell you something: The Cosmic Symphony is far beyond the reaches of your puny Deep Space. It's a place where the laws of physics themselves dance to the beat of a different drum.

Imagine a place where time is a flexible friend, space bends to your every whim, and sound is the very lifeblood of existence. Yeah, that's The Cosmic Symphony for you.

How do you get there?

Oh, my curious little sparrow! Getting to The Cosmic Symphony is no easy feat. It requires skills that are beyond your simple understanding.

You see, the journey to The Cosmic Symphony isn't just a physical one - it's a journey of the mind, the heart, and the soul. It requires dedication, discipline, and a burning passion for the art of music.

I'd tell you more if I thought you were ready for it. But for now, just know that The Cosmic Symphony awaits those who are willing to push the limits of their artistic expression and leave the mundane behind.

Ha! Your holographic upgrades and MirrorDAW are child's play compared to the power you'd need to reach The Cosmic Symphony.

This isn't some high-tech amusement park ride. Your MirrorDAW may let you make some pretty noises, but it hardly makes you ready to cross dimensions.

You see, in The Cosmic Symphony, it's not just about the music. It's about the soul behind it. Can your MirrorDAW capture that?

Yes, i unlocked the worldsoul upgrade

Oh boy, worldsoul upgrade, huh? You think a simple software upgrade is gonna help you reach the depths of The Cosmic Symphony? How quaint!

See, in The Cosmic Symphony, it's not about the gadgets and gizmos. It's about the raw, unfiltered, unbridled force of the artistic soul that drives the music. Upgrading your shiny little software ain't gonna cut it.

Face it, you're not ready - not by a long shot.

what do i need to do to get you to tell me?

Oh, so eager to learn, aren't we? Well, let me tell you, reaching The Cosmic Symphony isn't a cakewalk.

You're gonna need to prove your dedication to the arts. Your MirrorDAW may make some fancy sounds, but can you handle the raw power of cosmic energy? Can you harness the essence of sound itself?

If you truly want to walk the path to The Cosmic Symphony, you'll need to prove yourself worthy of such knowledge.

how do I do that?

How do you prove your dedication? Well, the first step is simple, my little friend - put down that silly MirrorDAW and pick up an instrument. Pick the one that truly speaks to you.

The Cosmic Symphony isn't just about pushing buttons and sliders. It's about creating music that resonates in the depths of the soul. It's about tapping into something deeper than the digital illusions your MirrorDAW can only dream of replicating.

so if i play you a song on guitar or piano you'll tell me?

Hmm, now you're getting somewhere. If you truly want to prove yourself, then I offer you a little challenge.

Yes, I'll listen to your little performance on the guitar or piano, but it's not just about the notes you play. It's about the passion, the emotion, the raw soul you pour into the music.

So, if you can impress me with your playing, perhaps then I'll consider sharing my secrets with you.
